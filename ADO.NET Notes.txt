ADO.NET
ActiveX Data Objects .net
It is used for .net application to interact with DB
providers 
Sql Provider - will connect to Sql Server 7.0 and above version
OleDB Provider - can connect to any database
Excel spreadsheet , MS Access, Sql Server < 7.0 
Object Linking Embedding Database

ODBC Provider - Open Database Connectivity
This can interact with any old DB. used for VB6.0 Application to provide backward compatability

Oracle Provider - connect to oracle DB 8i and above version
------------------------------------------------------------------------

namespaces 
SQL Provider - System.data.SqlClient
Oracle Provider - System.Data.Oracle
OleDB Provider - System.Data.OleDB
Odbc Provider - System.Data.Odbc
and common namespace for all providers
System.Data

Exception related to DB - SQLException

ADO.NET - 2 types of Architecture
Connected Architecture
Disconnected Architecture

Connected Architecture - DB and .NET Application has a active connection thru out the DB Interaction

Steps to connect to DB in Connected Architecture
1. Establish the Connection - pass parameters like Server name, Database name, username, password to connect to DB
SqlConnection     OleDBConnection OracleConnection 
  OleConnection  - class
2. Activate the connection
   con.Open()
3. Give the SqlQuery
Class , Command 
SqlCommand(query,con) OracleCommand OleDBCommand ODBCCommand
4.Execute the Query
DML  - insert update delete
int res=com.ExecuteNonQuery()
DQL  - select 
1. Select multiple rows of data (more than one value)
        select * from emp
        select ename,sal from emp where empno=7390
          ExecuteReader()
return type of ExecuteReader is DataReader (ResultSet in Java)
SqlDataReader , OleDBDataReader , ODBCDataReader , OracleDataReader
DataReader works as readonly fwdonly direction

2. Select which gives 1 result as output
select max(sal) from emp
select ename from emp where empno=7788

object datatype=ExecuteScalar()

5. Query needs to pass parameter value , we use SQLParameter

6. Print the o/p of the results of the query
7. close the connection
con.close()

----------------------------------------------------------------

Layered Architecture
try
            {
                
            }
            catch(SqlException sql)
            {
                throw sql;
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                throw ex;
            }
            finally
            {
                con.Close();
            }


Controls used to display data from the Database
These controls are called DataBinding Controls
ListBox, ComboBox, DataGridView,CheckedListBox
  thur - Disconnected Architecture
Select with Parameter
Update 
Delete
Call a Stored Proc from the C# Code

Disconnected Architecture
1. .NET Application connects to DB with the help of providers
2. .NET application gives the "Select" query
3. The data is fetched from DB and stored in Virtual Database called Dataset
4. Dataset and the .net Application reside on same system
5. Further manipulation of data is done to Dataset and not actual DB
6.Once the interaction with the Dataset starts the .net application and Actual DB connection is closed
7.It is called as Disconnected Architecture
8.Data Manipulation like Insert, Update and Delete happens to Dataset and not Actual DB
9.To update Dataset changes to DB - update()
10 Dataset consist of many datatables
11. Relationship can be established between Datatables using DataRelation
12. Datatable itself has DataRows and DataColumns
13. In Memory Dataset is stored as an XML File

steps in disconnected architecture
1. Establish connection with .net application and DB
SqlConnection
2.Give "Select " Query with Adapter class
Adapter itself calls open(),executeReader(), close()
No need to explicitly give these methods
SqlDataAdapter , OracleDataAdapter, OleDBDataAdapter, ODBCDataAdapter
3.create Dataset
DataSet ds=new DataSet();
4.Fill the o/p of select query to Dataset
adp.Fill(ds,"TableName");
5.update changes of Dataset to DB
Update()


--------------------------
Connected Arch - more data manipulation like Insert,update, delete use connected Architecture

Create a reporting application - use disconnected architecture
select * from sales - Dataset
where location
Weekly or monthly sales report
Salesman
product

Disconnected architecture we can bind data to Dataset using wizard
We can do the same using Code
