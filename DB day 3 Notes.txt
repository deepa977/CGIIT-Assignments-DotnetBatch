Index 
is used for retreival of data faster in a table
3 types of Index
Clustered Index  - is created on Primary Key column when primary key is created
There can be only one clustered index in a table
The sorting is done on the asc order of primary key values

Non Clustered Index - there can be upto 899 non clustered index created on a table
it can be created on any single or multiple columns
select ename from emp where ename like 'S%'
ENAME

if we create multiple column index
create index ind_Emp_Ename_Job on Emp(Ename,JOB)

create index ind_Emp_Ename_Job_Sal on Emp(Ename,JOB,Sal)


select ename from emp where ename like 'S%'

Unique Non Clustered Index

This index is created on Unique Contrainst Column
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

drop index indname
-----------------------------------------------------

sub queries
get empname earning max salary

select ename from emp where sal=max(sal)

But Aggr functions cannot be given directly in where clause
Subquery are created
Outer Query(Inner Query)
The Output of Inner Query becomes an input to the Where clause of Outer Query
-------------------
Views
views are temporary tables created from single or multiple base tables
they dont have their own structure
and they dont occupy extra memory space

Views are created so that complex query becomes easy to query every time you invoke it
 views are updatable
if the data is altered from view then the data in the base table also gets altered

views have to be updated based on condition then we use 'With Check Option'
we cannot insert or update the values to new value other than what was specified in the condition

Stored Procedure
-------------------------------

SP are like functions in C# which returns Void
Queries are written every time and executed
SP is an entity which will remain for ever in the DB

SP is called from C# application using ADO.NET

with parameter or without parameter
Parameter passed in Sql Server
syntax 
@paramname datatype

parameters are of 2 types
input parameter and output parameter
input parameter is for passing input values
The SP is returning a value is specified in output parameter
