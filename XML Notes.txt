XML , XSD and DTD

Extensible Markup Language
markup langauge - it is specified in Tags
The tags are user defined not inbuilt
It is not inbuilt like HTML(w3c) Tags


HTML - Design the web pages
XML - to transfer data across different languages
XML is a universal langauge and all applications can read data which is in XML


XML follows a structure to create a XML Document
XML Structure is called as Well Formness Rules

<?xml version="1.0" encoding=""?>
1.This is called as proluge
2.Every XMl document should have one Root Tag
<Employee_Details>
Tags in XML there should not be space or any spl characters in the tag name
It can have hypen or underscore

3. Every opening tag should have a closing tag
4. XML tags are case sensitive
5. Attribute values has to be in quotes ""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XML can have Elements or attributes
When to define Elements
<Address>
  <HouseNo>
   <StreetNo>
<landmark>
<area>
<pincode>
----------------------------
Attribute 
EmpID or RegNo or PanNo or Gender

XML has a parser inbuilt in browser which can check only well formness rules
The xml files are saved with .xml extension

To data validation XML has 2 supporting documents
DTD 
Document Type Definition
XSD
Extensible Schema Definition

---------------------------------
DTD can validate only the order of tags in XML Document
It does not support primitive data types (int , char , string)
Elements data is referred as #PCDATA (parsed character Data)
Attributes Data is referred as CDATA (Character Data)

DTD can be created as External DTD and Internal DTD
occurance of the tag. How many times the tags can be repeated

+ minimum 1 occurance (default)
*  0 or more occurance
? 0 or 1 occurance

Drawbacks of DTD
1. It does not support primitive data types to validate data
2. It does not follow XML Syntax. Developer has to learn a new syntax to work on DTD

XSD 
It validates data based on primitive data type
XSD validates the structure(order of tags) as well as data
XSD Tags are inbuilt
It is defined in the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
It follows XML Syntax
Root Tag name is <Schema>
<ComplexType> - defines the sequence of tags
<SimpleType> - define the data for the tags

XSD is preferred compared to DTD

XML can validate either DTD or XSD
Both it cannot validate in a single XML file

Reuse XSD in multiple XML Files

Reference the XML Schema in XML File
Namespace is "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
