Dynamic Polymorphism - Method Overriding

Inheritance
Getting the property from parent class and using them in child class is called inheritance
Adv : Reuability of Data
C# supports Single Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance
Oneparent class - inherits - one or more child classes
Accouts - Parents

keywords used in C# Inheritance
1. virtual and override
2. abstract and override
3.sealed
4.new
5.base

virtual and override
If parent class method has a function body it is defined as virtual
Same method is used in child class with a different function body it is defined as override

PersonInfo - id,name,email,address,gender,mobno,age
Student - rollno, course,branch, sem, aggrmarks, grade
Employee- empid,salary,dept,desg, exp

In inheritance concept the child class will by default call the default constructor of parent class

To call a parameterized constructor in inheritance it is called as constructor chaining
child class will call the parent class parameterized constructor


If parent class method does not have a fixed function body to define , mark the method as abstract
If a method is abstract , class also should be defined abstract
Object cannot be created for an abstract class
abstract methods has to be override in derived  class


Both Abstract and Virtual function in base class is used with override keyword in child class


sealed : it is used to prevent a class from inheritance
new - to prevent a method from override
