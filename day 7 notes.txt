Lambda Expressions
=>
Inbuilt extension methods to retreive data
We apply filters using lambda expression

int []arr={12,0,9,7,5,3,2,-1,4};
foreach(var a in arr)
{
if(a > 5)
C.WL(a);
}

foreach(var a in arr.Where(x=>x>5))
  C.WL(a);

Lambda expression can be used to retreive data from Arrays, Collection and DB

Condition given inside the extension methods is called predicate
variables declared for a predicate has the condition scope
variables are not declared initially and created as an expression
x=>condition

Dept - IT, Accounts,HR
Desg- Manager, Analyst, Clerk

SingleOrDefault - result will be EmployeeInfo

Multiple values
Result will be List<EmployeeInfo>

Linq Queries

Language Integrated Query
query language    lambda - expression Language
                                  extension methods to give condition

linq uses clauses to give the query

sql - select
         from
         where 


linq - from 
          where 
           select
